ProDet is implemented within the framework of [DeepfakeBench](https://github.com/SCLBD/DeepfakeBench). The provided code should be placed in the corresponding folders in DeepfakeBench, and test/train on DeepfakeBench as well. 

You may find the overall-best checkpoint of our method from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16IDcKVqziJ-Qv_IfZOAcYGwdeZAM-x5s?usp=drive_link), which is recommended for the comparing experiments in your own research. 

-------- UPDATE INFERENCE DEMO --------

To facilitate researchers in rapidly evaluating our detection results, we provide **Demo Code** that supports direct inference, as shown below:
```shell script
python ./demo/prodet_inference.py
```
The provided code is independent of the DeepfakeBench framework and can be **executed as a standalone script**. To utilize it, simply implement your customized data loading logic to fill the *Your inference code* in `prodet_inference.py`:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':

    detector=ProDet_infer().cuda()
    ckpt_path = 'training/weights/ProDet_best.pth'
    ckpt=torch.load(ckpt_path)
    detector.load_state_dict(ckpt,strict=False)
    '''
    Your inference code:
    datadict={}
    datadict['image']=image
    res=detector(datadict)
    '''
```
Alternatively, you may also directly integrate and utilize `ProDet_infer` within your own codebase for evaluation purposes.

-------- End Update --------

There is no additional package required beyond DeepfakeBench and this repository, hence you should easily reproduce the training of our paper with an established DeepfakeBench environment as:

```python
python training/train.py 
--detector_path 
./training/config/detector/prodet.yaml 
--train_dataset 
"FaceForensics++"  
--test_dataset 
"FaceForensics++" "Celeb-DF-v2" "DFDCP" 
```

You may also directly use the trained model for evaluation:

```python
python3 training/test.py 
--detector_path ./training/config/detector/prodet.yaml 
--test_dataset "Celeb-DF-v1" "Celeb-DF-v2" "DFDCP" 
--weights_path ./training/weights/ProDet_best.pth
```
